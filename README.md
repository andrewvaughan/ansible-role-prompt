# Prompt

[![Version][version-image]][github-release]
[![License][license-image]][github-license]
[![Build Status][build-image]][travis-detail]
[![Coverage][coverage-image]][coveralls-detail]

This [Ansible][ansible] module provides support to display simple messages to the user running a Playbook.  This
provides a cleaner way to present messages to the user than with the built-in [debug][ansible-debug] task.
Optionally, the message can also be treated as a prompt to await user feedback.  The response for these prompts can
be registered as Ansible variables.

## Installation

This plugin is made available in [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/).  Once Ansible Galaxy is installed, you
may install this plugin with the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install andrewvaughan.prompt
```

To use this plugin, simply add the role to your playbook file with the following addition:

```yml
roles:
- andrewvaughan.prompt
```

Once completed, you may use the entire plugin as described in the [Usage Guidelines](#usage)

### Manual Installation

To add this plugin to your project, simply copy the `/action_plugins/prompt.py` file to a folder named
`action_plugins` in your playbook root directory.  Ansible will automatically find and enable all commands made
available by the plugin, as detailed in the [Usage Guidelines](#usage).

### Dependencies

This module has been tested with [Ansible][ansible] v2.0 and above.  It may work with other versions, but they are not
formally supported.  Once Ansible and it's dependencies have been installed, this plugin should be usable.

## Usage

Functionality is currently very limited for the Ansible Prompt module.  At this point, only messaging the user is
supported.

The Ansible Prompt plugin takes a single parameter, `msg`, which can contain one-or-more messages for the user.
Examples tasks are as follows:

```yaml
- name: Simple Message
  prompt:
    msg: Hello World

- name: Multiple Messages
  prompt:
    msg:
      - Hello World
      - Hello Universe
```

### Alignment

> The `align` option does **not** work in tandem with the `ask` option

Messages can be aligned when presented to either `left` (default), `center`, or `right` justification:

```yaml
- name: Alignment Messages
    msg:
      - say: Left Alignment
        align: left
      - say: Center Alignment
        align: center
      - say: Right Alignment
        align: right
```

### Preventing Trailing Newline

> The `newline` option does **not** work in tandem with the `ask` option

In order to prevent the Ansible Prompt module from automatically adding a newline to the end of a message, simply
set the optional `newline` value to `false`:

```yaml
# Outputs "Start of line...middle of line...end of line" followed by newline
- name: No Newline Message
  prompt:
    msg:
      - say: "Start of line..."
        newline: false
      - say: "middle of line"
        newline: false
      - say: "...end of line"
```

### Gathering Facts From User Input

The strength of the prompt plugin comes from its ability to gather Ansible facts, as a task, during the run of a
playbook.  To turn your prompt into a question, provide a `say` and `ask` set of variables for each question you wish
to ask.

The `say` variable contains the message you wish to present, while the `ask` variable is the Ansible variable to
set globally from the user's input:

```yaml
- name: Simple Question
  prompt:
    msg:
      say: "What is your first name?"
      ask: first_name

- debug:
    var: first_name
```

As you can see, a `first_name` variable is set with the user's input during playback.

You may optionally ask multiple questions in the same prompt:

```yaml
- name: Address Information
  prompt:
    msg:
      - say: "Street Address:"
        ask: address
      - say: "City:"
        ask: city
      - say: "State:"
        ask: state
      - say: "Zip Code:"
        ask: zipcode
```

At this time, all variables are created upon the task completion.  Note that variables *cannot* be used until the task
is completed, so this will not work:

```yaml
- name: Address Information
  prompt:
    msg:
      - say: "First Name:"
        ask: first_name
      - say: "Hello {{ first_name }}!  What's your favorite color?"
        ask: color
```

Instead, these questions should be split into two separate `prompt` tasks.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why not just use Ansible debug and/or prompt_vars?

While Ansible does provide some basic messaging and reporting functionality, the built in `debug` and `prompt_vars`
methods have some drawbacks.  Specifically:

* `debug` is intended only for debugging, and thus does not present output in a presentation-formatted manner
* `prompt_vars` can only be used at the beginning of the script, limiting options for users that wish to wish to gather input during task playback
* `prompt_vars` has limited, if any, support for conditional logic
